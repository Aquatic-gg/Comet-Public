# Comet-Public
Public repository for Comet containing wiki and issues.

# TODO:
- Folders for effects (better file organization)
- Random sprite component (technically possible with javascript but could be made easier)
- Snowstorm file conversion
- Better color input method
- More informative formatting errors
- Cross-file macros
- Local/global emitter movement options
- Removal of teleportation packet usage (allow for smooth movement in versions before teleportation duration (like 1.19.4))
- Support for vanilla particle spawning
- Javascript optimization with caching (massive CPU-usage optimization)
- Particle data lookahead (for proper interpolation)
- Spawn back particles in once player is back in view.

## Features needed for full-ish Snowstorm integration:
- maximum particle amount for spawn rate components
- box, disc spawn shape
